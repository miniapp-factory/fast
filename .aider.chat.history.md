#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The only existing file that needs to be edited for this request is:

```
mini-app/lib/metadata.ts
```

Please add that file to the chat so I can provide the precise SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.  
I will also create a new file for the logo:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once you add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`, I can proceed with the edits.

The runner is depicted in motion, wearing light athletic gear, with a determined expression. The background features a soft gradient from warm orange at the horizon to a calm blue sky, evoking optimism and motivation for a healthy lifestyle.
